# More Java Computer Games

## Purpose
This repository showcases games using the object-oriented programming language known as Java. Unlike the games from the [preceding repository](https://github.com/CoderJ01/java-computer-games), these games make use of graphics and event-handling. The creation of these games help instill and reinforce intermediate level Java concepts. Anyone who wants to get their hands dirty and hone their already-existing Java programming skills should purchase the book â€œMore Do-It-Yourself Java Games'' by Annette Godland ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/More-Do-Yourself-Java-Games/dp/1519187998/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1663119410&sr=8-1)). Said book is the second book of a four-book series. Be sure to not copy and paste the code from a site you find online. Diligently type the code directly from the book so that you can more effectively absorb the concepts. Good luck!

Each game was first created in the development environment known as Eclispse. The games were then copied and pasted onto VS Code so that they could be pushed to this directory. Inside each project, there is a src folder with the code (.java) and a playable .jar file. Have fun!
